# Face-Impressions-Memory
Master's Thesis: The Neural Mechanisms by Which Facial Impressions Influence Memory

This repo contains the data and code that I used to complete my master's thesis, under the guidance of Gabriel Fajardo and Jon Freeman at the Social Cognitive and Neural Sciences Lab @ Columbia University!

This study is a secondary analysis using unidentified data collected from the
Who-Said What (WSW) study at the Social Cognitive and Neural Sciences Lab. The WSW dataset was adapted to the present study using existing Chicago Face Database normative ratings to explore possibilities related to trustworthiness and dominance. Otherwise, stimuli that better represented trustworthiness and dominance would have been selected.
