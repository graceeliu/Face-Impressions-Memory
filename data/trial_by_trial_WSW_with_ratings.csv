1,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
1,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
1,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
1,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
1,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857

1,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
1,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
1,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
1,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
1,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
1,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
1,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
1,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593

1,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333

1,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
1,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
1,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826

1,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852

1,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571

1,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
1,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfection—just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429

1,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution.

1,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
1,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852
1,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
1,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852

1,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391

1,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429

1,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into. We sat there and complained about our jobs during the day - and then it was their friends that kept things going after the party was over.

1,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074

1,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615

2,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194

It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
2,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
2,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931
2,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
2,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
2,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5
2,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
2,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
2,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615

2,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfection—just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931

2,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
2,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36
2,"I usually like these kinds of things. I overheard someone talking to his friend - saying ""Why didn't we go to that other place we were talking about?"" I couldn't agree more.",CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36
2,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667
2,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
2,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852
2,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857
2,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36
2,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571
2,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667
2,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
2,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
2,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
2,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852
2,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852
2,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571
2,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857

2,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571
2,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
2,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
2,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
2,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857
2,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
2,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to. I'm glad to hear other people agree with me that that place is really great.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818

2,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfection—just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
3,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125

3,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333

3,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games.

3,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56

3,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
3,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125

3,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
3,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
3,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution.

3,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857

3,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36
3,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
3,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
3,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36

4,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
4,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56

4,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
4,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826

4,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333

4,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics.

4,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0

4,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
4,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
4,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
4,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444

4,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571

4,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games.

4,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution.

4,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension.

5,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
5,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931

5,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
5,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
5,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037

5,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571

5,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into.

6,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
6,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
6,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
6,"He kept going on and on about how he's an expert in everything - and I'm thinking - ""Dude - you're not the boss of me."" I couldn't believe the nerve.",CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
6,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
6,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
6,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037

6,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
6,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
6,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
6,"He shrugged nonchalantly - ""I mean - what can you do when they keep changing the rules every five minutes? It's like trying to hit a moving target."" ",CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
6,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfection—just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
6,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
6,"The frustration just kept building. That's where I thought to myself ""sometimes it's better to let go than to hold onto pride"". Life is too short to let trivial disputes ruin good relationships.",CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
6,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
6,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
6,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
6,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
6,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286
6,"""I offered to help - but you know how it goes -"" he said - throwing up his hands in frustration. ""They insist they've got it all figured out - and then everything goes haywire."" ",CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
6,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
6,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
6,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
6,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286
6,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444

6,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857
6,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429

7,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
7,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
7,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
7,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
7,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
7,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
7,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
7,"""You're back - and let's see what today brings. Hopefully - nothing goes wrong this time -"" they commented. What's the use of investing time if it never works out?",CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
7,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
7,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571
7,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667
7,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857

7,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36
7,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
7,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
7,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36
7,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852
7,"I usually like these kinds of things. I overheard someone talking to his friend - saying ""Why didn't we go to that other place we were talking about?"" I couldn't agree more.",CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571
7,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857
7,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571
7,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
7,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852
7,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
7,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
7,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667
7,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
7,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852
7,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
7,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667
7,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857
7,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36
7,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
7,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to. I'm glad to hear other people agree with me that that place is really great.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286

7,"It was great. One of my friends was in the hospital when they came in and helped them. ""What is this? I didn't expect you to help out with this. I was given lots of warnings last time.

7,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
7,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296

7,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them?

7,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

7,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
7,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231

7,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
7,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931
7,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
7,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games.

7,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
7,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931
7,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5

7,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5
7,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
7,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231

8,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
8,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
8,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
8,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
8,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
8,"Yeah. My friends were there too - and they were just looking very dumbfounded. He said ""That's not what I heard - it doesn't sound right to me."" I agreed.",CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
8,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
8,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
8,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
8,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
8,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
8,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
8,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
8,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593

8,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
8,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333

8,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
8,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
8,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571

8,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics.

8,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0

8,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
8,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
8,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
8,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444

8,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games.

8,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution.

8,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension.

8,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857

8,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571

8,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571
8,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857

9,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
9,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037

9,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
9,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension.

9,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667

9,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852

9,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36

9,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667
9,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
9,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
9,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
9,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852
9,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852
9,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571

9,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571
9,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
9,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
9,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
9,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857
9,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
9,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to. I'm glad to hear other people agree with me that that place is really great.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818

9,Theirs? They would try and then fail - and then start kicking and swim. I decided that the next time they had even the least amount of trouble with it - I would go help them out the rest of the time.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826

9,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
9,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
9,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931
9,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
9,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
9,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5
9,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
9,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
9,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615

9,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfection—just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931

10,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
10,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56

10,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
10,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
10,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
10,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
10,"Yeah. My friends were there too - and they were just looking very dumbfounded. He said ""That's not what I heard - it doesn't sound right to me."" I agreed.",CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
10,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
10,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077

10,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
10,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
10,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
10,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
10,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
10,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
10,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56

10,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077

10,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
10,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286
10,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444

10,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
10,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296

10,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
10,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfection—just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
10,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
10,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
10,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games.

10,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
10,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
10,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
10,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
10,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
10,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
10,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
10,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
10,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
10,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
10,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
10,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615

10,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5
10,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
10,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231

10,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
10,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
10,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231

10,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931

10,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
10,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931
10,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension.

10,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615

10,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5
10,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5
11,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
11,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56

11,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
11,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125

11,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857

11,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826

11,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429

11,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
11,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics.

12,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
13,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593

13,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125

13,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857

13,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
13,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
13,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826

13,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
13,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296

13,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286
13,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037

13,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296

13,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
13,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931

13,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
13,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
13,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931

13,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
13,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
13,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286
13,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
13,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
13,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0

13,I didn't know what they were talking about. It was unclear. I got up when I heard a whistle. They were hesitant to step up and act like they meant it. Just sorting things I think. End of story.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0

13,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to. I'm glad to hear other people agree with me that that place is really great.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
13,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them? Some of that stuff was so fragile that it crumbled if you even looked at it the wrong way.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625

13,I loved it. They never complained about things being tough - but they were tough - but only when they needed to be. One hundred percent not just talk. I wish I could have gone back there.

13,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

14,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

15,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
15,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5
15,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
15,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0

15,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
15,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625

15,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
15,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
15,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
15,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194

15,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
15,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
15,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36

15,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857

15,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429

15,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
15,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games.

15,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
15,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfection—just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
15,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
15,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429

15,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
15,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571
15,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571
15,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667

15,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667

15,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36

17,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

18,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593

18,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
18,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
18,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857

18,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333

18,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
18,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
18,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
18,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593

18,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
18,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826

18,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension.

18,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391

18,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571

18,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571
18,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857

18,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074

18,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231

18,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
18,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0

19,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
19,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
19,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
19,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
19,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
19,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
19,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
19,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
19,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
19,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286
19,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
19,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
19,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
19,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286
19,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
19,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
19,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
19,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
19,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
19,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
19,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
19,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
19,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
19,"Yeah. My friends were there too - and they were just looking very dumbfounded. He said ""That's not what I heard - it doesn't sound right to me."" I agreed.",CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
19,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
19,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
19,"I asked him straight up - ""What's your problem?"" He started rambling about some imaginary slight - making no sense whatsoever. I couldn't follow his logic - and it just fueled the fire.",CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
19,"The whole room was watching - and it was clear he was just looking for attention. I wasn't about to let him make a scene. I shot back - ""You need to chill out and stop making a fool of yourself."" ",CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
19,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
19,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
19,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
19,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
19,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
19,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
19,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
19,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
19,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
19,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593

19,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
19,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36

19,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857

19,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429

19,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
19,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games.

19,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
19,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfection—just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
19,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
19,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
19,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852

19,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
19,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571

19,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667

19,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667
19,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852

20,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
20,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125

20,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125

20,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593

20,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
20,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension.

20,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to. I'm glad to hear other people agree with me that that place is really great.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286

20,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
20,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571
20,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667
20,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857
20,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852

20,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
20,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931

20,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics.

20,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
20,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194

20,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625

20,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
20,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games.

20,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution.

20,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
20,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231

21,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852

21,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them?

21,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into.

21,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
21,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826

21,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593

21,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
21,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension.

21,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077

21,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444

21,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0

21,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
21,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution.

21,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444

21,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
21,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296

21,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
21,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfection—just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
21,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
21,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
21,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games.

21,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
21,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
21,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0

21,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
21,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
21,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931

21,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
21,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0

21,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
21,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
21,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
21,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5
21,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
21,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0

21,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
21,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625

21,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
21,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
21,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0

22,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
22,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
22,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
22,"I usually like these kinds of things. I overheard someone talking to his friend - saying ""Why didn't we go to that other place we were talking about?"" I couldn't agree more.",CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
22,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
22,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
22,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
22,"They let me know ahead of time. They said ""Yeah we're going down this weekend. Can you and your friends make it?"" I'm sad to have missed it.",CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
22,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
22,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
22,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
22,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
22,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
22,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
22,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
22,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
22,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
22,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
22,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
22,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
22,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
22,Nah. I didn't reply at all. I let my actions speak louder than my words. I had a good plan. Their plan was really complicated.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
22,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to. I'm glad to hear other people agree with me that that place is really great.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931
22,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends. And I wouldn't have needed to do anything if they had just acted like civilized people.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
22,I loved it. They never complained about things being tough - but they were tough - but only when they needed to be. One hundred percent not just talk. I wish I could have gone back there. Having to leave that place sucked.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
22,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them?

22,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into.

23,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,2.0996785000315900,1,B,B,0,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
23,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,2.5777020833920700,0,B,B,1,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
23,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,4.577697333297690,0,B,W,0,1,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
23,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,3.5976696250145300,0,B,B,1,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
23,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,2.778662249969780,0,B,B,1,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
23,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,0.0,1,B,B,0,0,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286

23,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,0.0,0,B,B,1,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931

23,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,0.8688084583263840,1,B,B,0,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296

23,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to.

23,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,1.189838625025000,1,W,W,0,0,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857

23,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into. We sat there and complained about our jobs during the day - and then it was their friends that kept things going after the party was over. Yeah I had fun - and they made it a good night.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,1.782856666657610,1,W,W,0,0,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36

23,I didn't know what they were talking about. It was unclear. I got up when I heard a whistle. They were hesitant to step up and act like they meant it. Just sorting things I think. End of story.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,1.7717075832770200,1,W,W,0,0,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36

23,I loved it. They never complained about things being tough - but they were tough - but only when they needed to be. One hundred percent not just talk. I wish I could have gone back there.

23,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

24,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield.

24,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,3.2818819166666900,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857

24,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to.

24,We weren't going to deny that we were throwing things into the pile for them last time. They tripped and fell over when the others weren't looking.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,2.777749291679360,0,W,W,1,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
24,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

24,I didn't know what they were talking about. It was unclear. I got up when I heard a whistle. They were hesitant to step up and act like they meant it. Just sorting things I think. End of story.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,2.103632625017780,0,W,W,1,0,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
24,I loved it. They never complained about things being tough - but they were tough - but only when they needed to be. One hundred percent not just talk. I wish I could have gone back there.

24,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into.

24,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,2.1529310416663100,0,B,W,0,1,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615

24,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,3.4109674583305600,0,B,B,1,0,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074

24,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,4.068850499985270,0,B,W,0,1,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625

24,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,3.4777958749909900,0,B,W,0,1,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
25,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative.

25,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,3.942820666667100,1,B,B,0,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125

25,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,2.7824518333345600,0,W,W,1,0,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
25,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,2.0343319166677200,0,B,W,0,1,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
25,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,4.875301333333480,0,B,B,1,0,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286
25,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,2.930555249999090,0,W,B,0,1,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
25,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,2.0577747499992300,0,B,B,1,0,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931
25,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,3.1858564166668700,1,B,B,0,0,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5

25,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,3.113913666667940,0,B,W,0,1,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
25,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,2.65006162499958,0,W,B,0,1,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
25,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,5.991006291667870,1,W,W,0,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
25,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,2.5617880833342500,0,W,B,0,1,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
25,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,3.032660124999890,1,B,B,0,0,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5
25,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,5.802595250001100,1,W,W,0,0,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
25,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,1.806921166666140,0,W,B,0,1,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
25,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,1.401757291667310,1,W,W,0,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
25,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,3.192735750000790,0,B,B,1,0,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
25,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,2.0091133333335200,0,W,B,0,1,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
25,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,2.884794833333220,0,W,W,1,0,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625

25,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,5.730621541666550,1,W,W,0,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615

25,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,4.399561833333790,0,B,W,0,1,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
25,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,3.956348916668500,0,W,B,0,1,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5
25,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,1.0953660833347400,0,W,W,1,0,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
25,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,4.8173015833308500,0,B,W,0,1,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194

26,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into.

26,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,1.7179236666634100,1,B,B,0,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
26,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,1.474228499999300,1,W,W,0,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
26,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,0.0,0,W,B,0,1,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
26,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,0.903105499997764,1,B,B,0,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
26,"I usually like these kinds of things. I overheard someone talking to his friend - saying ""Why didn't we go to that other place we were talking about?"" I couldn't agree more.",CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,1.7908574166613100,0,W,W,1,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
26,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,0.0,0,W,W,1,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
26,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,1.4447890416668100,1,W,W,0,0,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
26,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,1.0826232916697300,1,W,W,0,0,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
26,"They let me know ahead of time. They said ""Yeah we're going down this weekend. Can you and your friends make it?"" I'm sad to have missed it.",CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,3.0245534166679100,0,B,B,1,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
26,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,0.0,1,W,W,0,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
26,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,2.39074791667008,0,B,B,1,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
26,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,1.351749249999560,1,B,B,0,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
26,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,0.525965749999159,1,B,B,0,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
26,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,2.536767541663720,0,B,W,0,1,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
26,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,1.4044988333334900,1,B,B,0,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
26,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,0.0,1,B,B,0,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
26,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,2.296595125000750,1,W,W,0,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
26,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,1.5205505416634000,0,W,W,1,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
26,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,0.0,1,B,B,0,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
26,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,1.3656414583310800,1,W,W,0,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
26,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,1.5509530833333000,1,W,W,0,0,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
26,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,5.631092291667300,0,W,W,1,0,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
26,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,2.766128999999640,0,W,B,0,1,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286
26,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,2.6069527083309400,1,B,B,0,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
26,"Yeah. My friends were there too - and they were just looking very dumbfounded. He said ""That's not what I heard - it doesn't sound right to me."" I agreed.",CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,1.1577742500012400,1,W,W,0,0,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
26,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,0.0,1,B,B,0,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
26,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,1.823988541669680,1,B,B,0,0,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286
26,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,1.8088012083353500,1,W,W,0,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
26,"""You're back - and let's see what today brings. Hopefully - nothing goes wrong this time -"" they commented. What's the use of investing time if it never works out?",CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,1.6362571666686600,1,B,B,0,0,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286
26,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,0.9989993749986750,1,B,B,0,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
26,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,0.0,0,W,W,1,0,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
26,"I asked him straight up - ""What's your problem?"" He started rambling about some imaginary slight - making no sense whatsoever.

26,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,0.0,1,W,W,0,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
26,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,2.3669567500001000,1,W,W,0,0,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
26,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,1.975948625000460,1,B,B,0,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
26,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,0.0,1,B,B,0,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
26,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,1.204643708333610,1,W,W,0,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
26,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,3.9889076249965,0,B,W,0,1,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0

26,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,0.8214000833359020,1,B,B,0,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
26,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,0.7516187500004890,1,B,B,0,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
26,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,1.338517124997450,1,W,W,0,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
26,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard.

26,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,0.8086421249972770,1,B,B,0,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
26,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,2.9032583333319100,0,B,W,0,1,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
26,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,1.9662116250001400,1,W,W,0,0,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231

26,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,5.176833666668240,0,B,W,0,1,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625

26,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant.

26,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,3.997293583335700,0,B,B,1,0,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5

26,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution.

26,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,3.2435713749982800,0,B,B,1,0,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931
26,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,4.397887249997440,1,B,B,0,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
26,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,1.824652708332000,0,W,B,0,1,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
26,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,2.9010507500024700,0,B,B,1,0,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5
26,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,3.855793499998980,0,B,W,0,1,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
26,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,1.6226396249985600,1,W,W,0,0,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
26,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,1.0903403750016900,1,W,W,0,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
26,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,2.256484416666350,0,W,B,0,1,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931
26,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfection—just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,2.6536976666648100,1,B,B,0,0,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931
26,"""It's the same routine every time -"" they said. ""They swoop in - create chaos - and vanish - leaving us to pick up the pieces."" ",CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,0.0,0,B,W,0,1,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
27,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,3.7520209166614200,0,W,W,1,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
27,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,4.220934749999290,1,B,B,0,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
27,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,3.743056625000460,0,B,B,1,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
27,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,1.9550764166670000,1,W,W,0,0,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
27,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,5.638018000001470,0,B,W,0,1,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
27,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,3.687026958334170,1,W,W,0,0,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
27,"They let me know ahead of time. They said ""Yeah we're going down this weekend. Can you and your friends make it?"" I'm sad to have missed it.",CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,1.014362499998240,0,W,W,1,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
27,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,5.677972624998800,0,B,B,1,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
27,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,1.404831166662920,0,W,W,1,0,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
27,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,1.4179009166691700,1,B,B,0,0,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286
27,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,2.819840000000110,0,B,W,0,1,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
27,"I usually like these kinds of things. I overheard someone talking to his friend - saying ""Why didn't we go to that other place we were talking about?"" I couldn't agree more.",CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,3.7648466666687500,0,B,W,0,1,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
27,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,2.4178832916659300,0,B,W,0,1,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
27,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,3.547954000001480,0,B,B,1,0,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286
27,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,2.212608249999900,1,W,W,0,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
27,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,0.0,1,B,B,0,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
27,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,5.381687249999230,0,B,W,0,1,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
27,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,2.5380163333356900,1,W,W,0,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
27,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,3.656466416668990,0,B,B,1,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
27,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,2.043415708329120,0,W,B,0,1,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
27,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,2.8665829166639000,0,B,B,1,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
27,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,3.3318762499984600,0,W,B,0,1,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
27,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,4.927669333330410,0,B,B,1,0,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286
27,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,3.1762931666671600,0,W,B,0,1,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444

27,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends. And I wouldn't have needed to do anything if they had just acted like civilized people.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,2.2130987083364700,1,B,B,0,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
27,Theirs? They would try and then fail - and then start kicking and swim. I decided that the next time they had even the least amount of trouble with it - I would go help them out the rest of the time.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,4.440019749999920,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857

27,"It was great. One of my friends was in the hospital when they came in and helped them. ""What is this? I didn't expect you to help out with this. I was given lots of warnings last time.

27,I loved it. They never complained about things being tough - but they were tough - but only when they needed to be. One hundred percent not just talk. I wish I could have gone back there.

27,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to.

27,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,2.7508936250014800,0,B,W,0,1,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593

27,I didn't know what they were talking about. It was unclear. I got up when I heard a whistle. They were hesitant to step up and act like they meant it. Just sorting things I think.

27,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,3.749049499998360,0,B,B,1,0,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667
27,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,2.839122541667170,0,B,B,1,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852

27,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,2.87795987500067,0,B,B,1,0,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571

27,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,1.6508733333321300,1,B,B,0,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
27,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfection—just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,3.4968925416651500,0,B,W,0,1,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
27,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,3.0037076250009700,0,W,W,1,0,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857
27,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,5.224598458335100,0,B,W,0,1,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36
27,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution.

27,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,4.223775666669100,0,W,B,0,1,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
27,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,4.7386843749991400,0,W,B,0,1,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852
27,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,3.6176526249983,0,W,W,1,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
27,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,0.0,0,B,B,1,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852

27,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant.

27,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,4.728599250000120,0,W,B,0,1,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
27,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games.

27,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,4.425600583337660,0,W,W,1,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429

27,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,5.909063833336400,0,B,W,0,1,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615

27,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,3.9984677083339200,1,B,B,0,0,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5

27,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,2.4078934999997700,0,B,W,0,1,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
27,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,4.828030333334030,0,B,B,1,0,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5

27,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,4.96578587499971,0,B,W,0,1,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
27,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative.

27,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,4.046322458332730,0,B,B,1,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
27,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,3.805577083334360,0,B,W,0,1,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615

27,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,5.018071791670080,0,W,B,0,1,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
27,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,2.6335484583323700,0,W,B,0,1,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
28,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,3.5340395833336500,1,B,B,0,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
28,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,2.5549547916671100,1,W,W,0,0,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
28,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,2.0407555416677500,0,B,W,0,1,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
28,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,1.8101296249951700,0,W,B,0,1,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125

28,"They let me know ahead of time. They said ""Yeah we're going down this weekend. Can you and your friends make it?"" I'm sad to have missed it.",CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,1.7430201666647900,0,B,B,1,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
28,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,3.562815124998450,0,W,B,0,1,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
28,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,0.0,0,W,B,0,1,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
28,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,3.016055874999440,0,W,W,1,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
28,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,3.2846986666627300,0,W,B,0,1,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
28,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,2.206599583332720,0,W,B,0,1,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
28,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,3.934811874998560,0,W,W,1,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
28,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,0.0,0,B,W,0,1,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
28,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,2.088692125005760,0,B,B,1,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
28,"I usually like these kinds of things. I overheard someone talking to his friend - saying ""Why didn't we go to that other place we were talking about?"" I couldn't agree more.",CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,2.231675125003680,0,W,W,1,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
28,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,1.5317769166649700,0,W,B,0,1,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
28,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,2.548624208335240,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
28,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,1.998447416670390,0,W,W,1,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
28,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,3.310596041657850,1,W,W,0,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
28,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,1.2028271249946600,0,B,B,1,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
28,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,3.9106950416608000,0,W,W,1,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
28,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,1.4486741666769400,0,B,W,0,1,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
28,"He kept going on and on about how he's an expert in everything - and I'm thinking - ""Dude - you're not the boss of me."" I couldn't believe the nerve.",CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,1.1369597500015500,0,B,W,0,1,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
28,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,4.364955416662270,0,W,B,0,1,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
28,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,4.70891554166883,0,B,W,0,1,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
28,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,4.089079874996970,0,B,W,0,1,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037

28,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,2.1056547916596200,0,W,B,0,1,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
28,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,1.123867333328240,0,B,W,0,1,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
28,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,2.3620718749953100,0,W,W,1,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
28,"He shrugged nonchalantly - ""I mean - what can you do when they keep changing the rules every five minutes? It's like trying to hit a moving target."" ",CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,1.073755458332020,0,W,B,0,1,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
28,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfection—just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,1.060927583333980,0,W,W,1,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
28,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,3.339899583326770,0,B,W,0,1,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
28,"The frustration just kept building. That's where I thought to myself ""sometimes it's better to let go than to hold onto pride"".

28,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,5.798804124999150,0,W,B,0,1,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
28,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,3.924920375000510,0,B,B,1,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931
28,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,0.795948083337862,0,B,W,0,1,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0
28,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,1.6107968333308200,0,B,B,1,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
28,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,5.7057903750028300,0,W,B,0,1,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286

28,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,3.0087774166677300,0,W,W,1,0,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
28,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,3.610758666669430,0,W,W,1,0,WM-219,WM-219,3.25,2.833333333
28,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games.

28,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,1.278636708339040,0,W,B,0,1,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286
28,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,0.8779407916663330,0,W,B,0,1,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
28,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,3.5441371249980900,0,B,B,1,0,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571

28,I didn't know what they were talking about. It was unclear. I got up when I heard a whistle. They were hesitant to step up and act like they meant it. Just sorting things I think.

28,Theirs? They would try and then fail - and then start kicking and swim.

28,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,3.0082403749984200,0,W,W,1,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
28,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into. We sat there and complained about our jobs during the day - and then it was their friends that kept things going after the party was over.

28,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them?

28,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,4.671207208339180,0,B,W,0,1,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194

28,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,2.2394562083354700,0,W,B,0,1,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
28,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,2.83787345833116,0,B,W,0,1,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615

29,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,4.711026833341750,1,W,W,0,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857

29,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games.

29,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,2.450037833332320,0,W,B,0,1,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
29,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,5.715086958334720,0,B,W,0,1,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
29,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics.

29,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant.

29,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,0.6998242499976190,0,B,B,1,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
29,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,1.3906385416630700,0,B,B,1,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125

29,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,4.398444958336770,0,B,W,0,1,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
29,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,1.5596377500041900,0,B,W,0,1,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
29,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,3.5665334583391100,0,B,W,0,1,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593

29,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,3.1244790833370600,0,W,W,1,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857

29,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

29,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,3.6197493333311300,0,W,B,0,1,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
29,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,5.825876083334150,0,B,W,0,1,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
29,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,3.850931999993920,0,W,B,0,1,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
29,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,2.698847041676350,0,W,B,0,1,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
29,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,2.28183583333157,0,W,W,1,0,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
29,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,5.876670750003540,0,B,B,1,0,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931
29,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,1.8719352916741600,0,B,W,0,1,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
29,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen.""

29,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,5.219722958339840,0,B,W,0,1,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
29,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,2.7056129583288600,0,W,B,0,1,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5
29,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,0.0044482500015874,0,W,W,1,0,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
29,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,2.8925522083372900,1,W,W,0,0,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
29,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,5.171489250002200,0,B,B,1,0,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
29,"I usually like these kinds of things. I overheard someone talking to his friend - saying ""Why didn't we go to that other place we were talking about?"" I couldn't agree more.",CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,2.035580499999920,0,B,W,0,1,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
29,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,3.616694583324720,0,W,W,1,0,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
30,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfection—just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,4.350253958327810,0,B,W,0,1,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
30,"The frustration just kept building. That's where I thought to myself ""sometimes it's better to let go than to hold onto pride"".

30,"It was ridiculous. We were arguing in circles - and I'm thinking - ""Is this really happening right now?"" I just wanted to grab my stuff and get on out of there.",CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,3.206987791680150,0,W,B,0,1,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
30,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,1.0638901250058600,1,B,B,0,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
30,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,5.671388166665570,0,W,B,0,1,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
30,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,1.460902624996380,0,W,W,1,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
30,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,2.681110291654480,0,W,W,1,0,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
30,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,0.7352206249925080,0,W,B,0,1,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
30,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,5.24289312500332,0,B,W,0,1,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
30,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,1.8219154166581600,0,B,B,1,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
30,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,2.755016583323600,0,W,W,1,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
30,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,2.47972408332862,1,W,W,0,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
30,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,2.9659119583229800,1,W,W,0,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
30,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,1.890636833340980,1,B,B,0,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
30,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,2.8347435416653800,0,B,W,0,1,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
30,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,1.519681166668310,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857

30,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,2.79966649999551,1,B,B,0,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
30,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,0.8718246666685450,0,W,B,0,1,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077

30,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,1.5054659166635200,0,B,W,0,1,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56

30,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,1.3043985833210200,0,W,B,0,1,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826

30,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to.

30,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,4.826838541674080,1,W,W,0,0,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857

30,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into.

30,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

30,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,5.078387458328510,0,W,W,1,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429

30,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them?

30,"""You're back now. And we'll see what happens today and if we can actually go a full day without the thing going until it breaks"" - they said.

30,Nah. I didn't reply at all. I let my actions speak louder than my words. I had a good plan. Their plan was really complicated.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,5.004421041667230,0,B,B,1,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852

30,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,3.254947541674480,1,B,B,0,0,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286

30,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,1.9920497916609700,0,B,W,0,1,WM-029,WM-029,3.701149425,2.821428571
30,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,5.704997791675850,0,W,W,1,0,WM-210,WM-210,3.321428571,2.0

30,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,0.0,1,B,B,0,0,BM-202,BM-202,3.296296296,3.296296296
30,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension.

30,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,1.674837208338430,0,W,W,1,0,WM-241,WM-241,3.111111111,4.037037037
30,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,3.04551454167813,0,B,B,1,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
30,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,5.056596249996800,0,B,B,1,0,BM-227,BM-227,3.814814815,3.444444444
30,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,5.180633541662250,0,B,B,1,0,BM-009,BM-009,3.102040816,2.535714286

30,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,1.8648152083478600,0,B,B,1,0,BM-026,BM-026,3.666666667,3.724137931

30,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,4.2407214583217900,0,W,B,0,1,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931
30,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,5.658811750006860,0,W,W,1,0,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
30,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,2.370788750005890,1,W,W,0,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
30,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,0.0,1,B,B,0,0,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5
30,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,2.39380754166632,0,B,W,0,1,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
30,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,3.010943250003040,0,B,B,1,0,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
30,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,1.2155963750119600,1,W,W,0,0,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
30,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,2.144661500002260,0,B,W,0,1,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
30,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,5.923560458337310,0,W,B,0,1,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931
30,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,5.521614583340120,0,W,W,1,0,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
30,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,5.404579125010060,0,W,W,1,0,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194

30,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,1.6926026666769800,0,W,B,0,1,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
30,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,4.892676208328340,0,B,B,1,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0

30,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,2.3902097916579800,0,W,W,1,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615

31,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,2.430233749997570,1,W,W,0,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818
31,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,2.3641513333423100,1,W,W,0,0,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
31,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant.

31,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfection—just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,3.716150041669610,1,W,W,0,0,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
31,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,4.303876916674200,0,B,B,1,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125

31,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,4.897006750004950,0,B,B,1,0,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
31,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,3.535055458327410,1,B,B,0,0,BM-032,BM-032,3.659090909,3.304347826
31,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,1.7170996666827700,0,B,B,1,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
31,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,4.263865458327930,0,B,W,0,1,WM-236,WM-236,3.0,1.56
31,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,0.0,0,W,W,1,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
31,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,3.42481870832853,0,W,W,1,0,WM-238,WM-238,3.0,3.318181818

31,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,4.552862374999680,1,B,B,0,0,BM-216,BM-216,3.851851852,2.576923077
31,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,5.666795958328290,0,B,B,1,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125

31,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,3.9360390416550200,0,W,B,0,1,BM-043,BM-043,4.170454545,3.708333333
31,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,5.916758291656150,0,B,B,1,0,BM-004,BM-004,3.178294574,2.6953125
31,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,3.7683758749917600,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
31,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,3.5268421666696700,1,W,W,0,0,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36
31,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,4.774891708337240,0,B,W,0,1,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36
31,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,3.840773208343310,1,B,B,0,0,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667
31,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,5.979816208317060,0,B,B,1,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
31,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,2.63874633332307,0,B,W,0,1,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857
31,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,2.459140541672240,0,B,W,0,1,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429

31,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,2.2195962916594,0,W,B,0,1,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391

31,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,0.9157504999893720,0,B,W,0,1,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
31,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,0.0,0,W,B,0,1,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571

31,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,5.639367625000890,0,W,B,0,1,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571

32,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield.

32,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,3.5264947916730300,1,W,W,0,0,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
32,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,2.73871337500168,0,B,W,0,1,WM-020,WM-020,3.068181818,2.592592593
32,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,3.461532541667110,0,B,W,0,1,WM-225,WM-225,3.703703704,3.107142857
32,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,2.5456907083280400,0,B,B,1,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852
32,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,4.670912624991620,0,B,W,0,1,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857
32,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,1.4210805833427000,1,W,W,0,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
32,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,1.6482390833407400,1,W,W,0,0,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36
32,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,5.951138333330160,0,B,W,0,1,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
32,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,2.4600782916677400,1,B,B,0,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
32,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,2.29081004166801,0,W,B,0,1,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571
32,"I asked him straight up - ""What's your problem?"" He started rambling about some imaginary slight - making no sense whatsoever. I couldn't follow his logic - and it just fueled the fire.",CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,0.5100812916789440,0,B,B,1,0,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667
32,"The whole room was watching - and it was clear he was just looking for attention. I wasn't about to let him make a scene.

32,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,2.254832374994290,0,B,B,1,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852
32,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,0.0,0,B,W,0,1,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
32,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,0.6920955416571820,1,W,W,0,0,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857
32,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,2.589908583337090,0,B,W,0,1,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36
32,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,1.6370543749944800,1,B,B,0,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
32,"""You're back - and let's see what today brings. Hopefully - nothing goes wrong this time -"" they commented. What's the use of investing time if it never works out?",CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,1.5417092083371200,0,W,B,0,1,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667
32,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,4.660697749990500,0,B,B,1,0,BM-046,BM-046,3.494252874,3.565217391
32,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,2.920928208346600,1,W,W,0,0,WM-223,WM-223,3.0,4.36
32,"Yeah. My friends were there too - and they were just looking very dumbfounded. He said ""That's not what I heard - it doesn't sound right to me."" I agreed.",CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,1.556862416662630,1,W,W,0,0,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
32,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,2.697874875011620,0,B,B,1,0,BM-209,BM-209,3.607142857,3.071428571
32,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,3.8596449166798300,1,B,B,0,0,BM-020,BM-020,3.779069767,2.416666667
32,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,0.8078432083275400,0,B,W,0,1,WM-230,WM-230,3.392857143,2.678571429
32,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,3.553705833328420,1,W,W,0,0,WM-001,WM-001,3.215053763,1.857142857
32,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,2.040397041666440,1,W,W,0,0,WM-031,WM-031,3.390804598,2.928571429
32,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,2.2826780833274800,1,B,B,0,0,BM-207,BM-207,3.607142857,2.851851852
32,"Yeah they did a good job of avoiding embarrassment. I told them: ""Watch it out there. If the wind starts whipping around again - you're gonna get rained out.

32,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to.

32,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

32,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,3.080819874987360,0,W,B,0,1,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
32,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,3.53812562499661,0,W,W,1,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
32,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,4.231879083337840,0,W,B,0,1,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
32,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,0.7452044999954520,1,B,B,0,0,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5
32,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,5.200628791673810,0,W,W,1,0,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
32,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,0.9448837083182300,0,B,B,1,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
32,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,1.0376464583387100,0,W,W,1,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
32,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,2.463810499990360,1,B,B,0,0,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
32,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,1.441694124994680,1,B,B,0,0,BM-041,BM-041,3.69047619,3.0
32,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,0.9239373750024240,0,W,W,1,0,WM-207,WM-207,3.333333333,3.625
32,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,5.176541708322480,0,B,B,1,0,BM-250,BM-250,3.620689655,3.724137931
32,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,0.8638560416584370,0,W,W,1,0,WM-247,WM-247,3.230769231,2.615384615
32,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,5.755822333332620,0,B,W,0,1,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
32,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,0.8978352499980250,0,B,W,0,1,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
32,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,0.0,1,B,B,0,0,BM-017,BM-017,3.285714286,3.5
32,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,5.706815750003440,0,B,W,0,1,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
32,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,0.0,0,W,W,1,0,WM-040,WM-040,3.419354839,3.096774194
32,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,0.0,0,W,B,0,1,BM-022,BM-022,3.747252747,4.074074074
32,"I usually like these kinds of things. I overheard someone talking to his friend - saying ""Why didn't we go to that other place we were talking about?"" I couldn't agree more.",CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,2.145538333323200,0,B,W,0,1,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
32,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,3.875442958320490,0,W,W,1,0,WM-254,WM-254,3.230769231,3.230769231
