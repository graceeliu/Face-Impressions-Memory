1,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
1,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
1,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
1,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
1,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
1,"Yeah. My friends were there too - and they were just looking very dumbfounded. He said ""That's not what I heard - it doesn't sound right to me."" I agreed.",CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
1,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
1,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
1,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
1,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
1,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
1,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
1,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
1,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
1,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
1,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
1,"The whole room was watching - and it was clear he was just looking for attention. I wasn't about to let him make a scene. I shot back - ""You need to chill out and stop making a fool of yourself."" ",CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
1,"""You're back - and let's see what today brings. Hopefully - nothing goes wrong this time -"" they commented. What's the use of investing time if it never works out?",CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
1,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
1,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
1,"I asked him straight up - ""What's your problem?"" He started rambling about some imaginary slight - making no sense whatsoever. I couldn't follow his logic - and it just fueled the fire.",CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
1,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
1,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
1,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
1,"""I offered to help - but you know how it goes -"" he said - throwing up his hands in frustration. ""They insist they've got it all figured out - and then everything goes haywire."" ",CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

1,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
1,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
1,"He kept going on and on about how he's an expert in everything - and I'm thinking - ""Dude - you're not the boss of me."" I couldn't believe the nerve.",CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
1,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
1,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
1,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
1,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfectionâ€”just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
1,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
1,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
1,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
1,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
1,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
1,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
1,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
1,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
1,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

1,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
1,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
1,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
1,"The frustration just kept building. That's where I thought to myself ""sometimes it's better to let go than to hold onto pride"". Life is too short to let trivial disputes ruin good relationships.",CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

1,"Yeah they did a good job of avoiding embarrassment. I told them: ""Watch it out there. If the wind starts whipping around again - you're gonna get rained out.

1,We weren't going to deny that we were throwing things into the pile for them last time. They tripped and fell over when the others weren't looking.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
1,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends. And I wouldn't have needed to do anything if they had just acted like civilized people.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
1,I didn't know what they were talking about. It was unclear. I got up when I heard a whistle. They were hesitant to step up and act like they meant it. Just sorting things I think. End of story.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
1,I loved it. They never complained about things being tough - but they were tough - but only when they needed to be. One hundred percent not just talk. I wish I could have gone back there. Having to leave that place sucked.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

1,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them? Some of that stuff was so fragile that it crumbled if you even looked at it the wrong way.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
1,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0

1,Nah. I didn't reply at all. I let my actions speak louder than my words. I had a good plan. Their plan was really complicated.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

1,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into.

1,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
1,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

1,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

1,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0

1,"I usually like these kinds of things. I overheard someone talking to his friend - saying ""Why didn't we go to that other place we were talking about?"" I couldn't agree more.",CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
1,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
2,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
2,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
2,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
2,"Yeah. My friends were there too - and they were just looking very dumbfounded. He said ""That's not what I heard - it doesn't sound right to me."" I agreed.",CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
2,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
2,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
2,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
2,"""You're back - and let's see what today brings. Hopefully - nothing goes wrong this time -"" they commented. What's the use of investing time if it never works out?",CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
2,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
2,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
2,"I asked him straight up - ""What's your problem?"" He started rambling about some imaginary slight - making no sense whatsoever. I couldn't follow his logic - and it just fueled the fire.",CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
2,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
2,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
2,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
2,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
2,"The whole room was watching - and it was clear he was just looking for attention. I wasn't about to let him make a scene. I shot back - ""You need to chill out and stop making a fool of yourself."" ",CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
2,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
2,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
2,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
2,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
2,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
2,"He shrugged nonchalantly - ""I mean - what can you do when they keep changing the rules every five minutes? It's like trying to hit a moving target."" ",CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
2,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
2,"It was ridiculous. We were arguing in circles - and I'm thinking - ""Is this really happening right now?"" I just wanted to grab my stuff and get on out of there.",CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
2,"The frustration just kept building. That's where I thought to myself ""sometimes it's better to let go than to hold onto pride"". Life is too short to let trivial disputes ruin good relationships.",CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
2,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
2,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,"""I offered to help - but you know how it goes -"" he said - throwing up his hands in frustration. ""They insist they've got it all figured out - and then everything goes haywire."" ",CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,"He kept going on and on about how he's an expert in everything - and I'm thinking - ""Dude - you're not the boss of me."" I couldn't believe the nerve.",CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
2,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
2,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
2,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
2,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
2,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
2,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
2,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
2,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
2,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfectionâ€”just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,"""It's the same routine every time -"" they said. ""They swoop in - create chaos - and vanish - leaving us to pick up the pieces."" ",CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
2,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
2,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

2,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
2,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
2,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

2,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
2,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
2,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
2,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
2,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0

2,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
2,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
2,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
2,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
2,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
2,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
2,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to. I'm glad to hear other people agree with me that that place is really great.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

2,Theirs? They would try and then fail - and then start kicking and swim. I decided that the next time they had even the least amount of trouble with it - I would go help them out the rest of the time.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

2,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends. And I wouldn't have needed to do anything if they had just acted like civilized people.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
2,They were gonna paddle to me. I was shaking all over - I had the same experiences they all did. And they were the only ones who seemed to be able to help me. What does that say about them?,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
2,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
2,"I heard some people. It was the sound of their friends outside. Someone told me how many there were when they went out and looked. Then they said: ""Hey - give them what you just gave to me - and see how they like it."" ",CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

2,I was in my place with my friends - and they were getting out of the way. I slept like a baby. There wasn't any conflict.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
2,I didn't know what they were talking about. It was unclear. I got up when I heard a whistle. They were hesitant to step up and act like they meant it. Just sorting things I think. End of story.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
2,We weren't going to deny that we were throwing things into the pile for them last time. They tripped and fell over when the others weren't looking.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them? Some of that stuff was so fragile that it crumbled if you even looked at it the wrong way.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
2,"It was great. One of my friends was in the hospital when they came in and helped them. ""What is this? I didn't expect you to help out with this. I was given lots of warnings last time.

2,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

2,Nah. I didn't reply at all. I let my actions speak louder than my words. I had a good plan. Their plan was really complicated.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
2,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into. We sat there and complained about our jobs during the day - and then it was their friends that kept things going after the party was over.

2,I loved it. They never complained about things being tough - but they were tough - but only when they needed to be. One hundred percent not just talk. I wish I could have gone back there. Having to leave that place sucked.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

3,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
3,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
3,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
3,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
3,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
3,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfectionâ€”just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
3,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

3,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
3,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
3,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
3,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
3,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
3,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

3,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
3,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

3,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
3,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
3,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
3,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
3,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
3,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

3,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
3,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
3,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

3,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
3,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
3,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
3,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
3,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

3,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
3,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to. I'm glad to hear other people agree with me that that place is really great.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

3,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
3,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
3,We weren't going to deny that we were throwing things into the pile for them last time. They tripped and fell over when the others weren't looking.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
3,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them? Some of that stuff was so fragile that it crumbled if you even looked at it the wrong way.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

3,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

3,"""You're back now. And we'll see what happens today and if we can actually go a full day without the thing going until it breaks"" - they said. Seriously - what's the point of spending time on something like that if it never turns out right?",CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
3,"I heard some people. It was the sound of their friends outside. Someone told me how many there were when they went out and looked. Then they said: ""Hey - give them what you just gave to me - and see how they like it."" ",CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
3,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into.

3,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

4,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

4,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into.

4,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

4,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

4,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
4,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
4,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
4,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
4,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
4,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
4,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
4,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
4,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
4,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
4,"I usually like these kinds of things. I overheard someone talking to his friend - saying ""Why didn't we go to that other place we were talking about?"" I couldn't agree more.",CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
4,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
5,"The whole room was watching - and it was clear he was just looking for attention. I wasn't about to let him make a scene. I shot back - ""You need to chill out and stop making a fool of yourself."" ",CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
5,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
5,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
5,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
5,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
5,"I asked him straight up - ""What's your problem?"" He started rambling about some imaginary slight - making no sense whatsoever. I couldn't follow his logic - and it just fueled the fire.",CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
5,"""You're back - and let's see what today brings. Hopefully - nothing goes wrong this time -"" they commented. What's the use of investing time if it never works out?",CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
5,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
5,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
5,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
5,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
5,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
5,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
5,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
5,"Yeah. My friends were there too - and they were just looking very dumbfounded. He said ""That's not what I heard - it doesn't sound right to me."" I agreed.",CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
5,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
5,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
5,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
5,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
5,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
5,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
5,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
5,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
5,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
5,"""You're back now. And we'll see what happens today and if we can actually go a full day without the thing going until it breaks"" - they said. Seriously - what's the point of spending time on something like that if it never turns out right?",CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
5,They were gonna paddle to me. I was shaking all over - I had the same experiences they all did. And they were the only ones who seemed to be able to help me. What does that say about them?,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
5,Theirs? They would try and then fail - and then start kicking and swim. I decided that the next time they had even the least amount of trouble with it - I would go help them out the rest of the time.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
5,I was in my place with my friends - and they were getting out of the way. I slept like a baby. There wasn't any conflict.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

5,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into. We sat there and complained about our jobs during the day - and then it was their friends that kept things going after the party was over. Yeah I had fun - and they made it a good night.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
5,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
5,"They said ""We'll be heading down - no problem. But not until we make sure you and your friends are okay. Did you bring a first aid kit? You're gonna need it."" ",CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
5,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
5,"They said ""Oh really? You're gonna go with us? You and all of your friends (and I'm counting all three of them) - are gonna have a great time going over there - and I think you're gonna like it."" ",CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
5,"It was great. One of my friends was in the hospital when they came in and helped them. ""What is this? I didn't expect you to help out with this. I was given lots of warnings last time. It would have been so easy to have just given up on me"" they said.",CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
5,"I heard some people. It was the sound of their friends outside. Someone told me how many there were when they went out and looked. Then they said: ""Hey - give them what you just gave to me - and see how they like it."" ",CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
5,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them? Some of that stuff was so fragile that it crumbled if you even looked at it the wrong way.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
5,"Yeah they did a good job of avoiding embarrassment. I told them: ""Watch it out there. If the wind starts whipping around again - you're gonna get rained out.

5,We weren't going to deny that we were throwing things into the pile for them last time. They tripped and fell over when the others weren't looking.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
5,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to. I'm glad to hear other people agree with me that that place is really great.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

5,I loved it. They never complained about things being tough - but they were tough - but only when they needed to be. One hundred percent not just talk. I wish I could have gone back there. Having to leave that place sucked.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
5,Nah. I didn't reply at all. I let my actions speak louder than my words. I had a good plan. Their plan was really complicated.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0

5,I didn't know what they were talking about. It was unclear. I got up when I heard a whistle. They were hesitant to step up and act like they meant it. Just sorting things I think. End of story.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

5,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends. And I wouldn't have needed to do anything if they had just acted like civilized people.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

5,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
5,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
5,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
5,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
5,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
5,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfectionâ€”just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

5,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
5,"The frustration just kept building. That's where I thought to myself ""sometimes it's better to let go than to hold onto pride"". Life is too short to let trivial disputes ruin good relationships.",CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
5,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
5,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
5,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
5,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

5,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
5,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

5,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
5,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
5,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
5,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
5,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0

5,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
5,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
5,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

5,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
5,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

5,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

5,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

5,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

6,"""You're back now. And we'll see what happens today and if we can actually go a full day without the thing going until it breaks"" - they said. Seriously - what's the point of spending time on something like that if it never turns out right?",CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
6,They were gonna paddle to me. I was shaking all over - I had the same experiences they all did. And they were the only ones who seemed to be able to help me. What does that say about them?,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

6,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into.

6,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

6,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

6,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them? Some of that stuff was so fragile that it crumbled if you even looked at it the wrong way.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
6,"Yeah they did a good job of avoiding embarrassment. I told them: ""Watch it out there. If the wind starts whipping around again - you're gonna get rained out.

7,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them? Some of that stuff was so fragile that it crumbled if you even looked at it the wrong way.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0

7,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

7,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into.

8,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
8,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
8,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
8,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

8,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
8,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
8,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
8,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
8,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
8,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
8,"They let me know ahead of time. They said ""Yeah we're going down this weekend. Can you and your friends make it?"" I'm sad to have missed it.",CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
8,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
8,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
8,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
8,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
8,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
8,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
8,"I usually like these kinds of things. I overheard someone talking to his friend - saying ""Why didn't we go to that other place we were talking about?"" I couldn't agree more.",CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
8,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
8,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
8,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
8,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
8,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
8,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
8,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
8,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
8,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
8,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
8,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
8,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
8,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
9,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
9,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
9,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
9,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
9,"Yeah. My friends were there too - and they were just looking very dumbfounded. He said ""That's not what I heard - it doesn't sound right to me."" I agreed.",CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
9,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
9,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
9,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
9,"""You're back - and let's see what today brings. Hopefully - nothing goes wrong this time -"" they commented. What's the use of investing time if it never works out?",CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
9,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
9,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
9,"I asked him straight up - ""What's your problem?"" He started rambling about some imaginary slight - making no sense whatsoever. I couldn't follow his logic - and it just fueled the fire.",CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
9,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
9,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
9,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
9,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
9,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
9,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
9,"The whole room was watching - and it was clear he was just looking for attention. I wasn't about to let him make a scene. I shot back - ""You need to chill out and stop making a fool of yourself."" ",CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
9,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
9,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
9,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
9,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
9,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

9,I loved it. They never complained about things being tough - but they were tough - but only when they needed to be. One hundred percent not just talk. I wish I could have gone back there. Having to leave that place sucked.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
9,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
9,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

9,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
9,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

9,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
9,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
9,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
9,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
9,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
9,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
9,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
9,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
9,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
9,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
9,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
9,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
9,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfectionâ€”just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

10,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
10,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
10,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
10,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
10,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
10,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
10,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
10,"Yeah. My friends were there too - and they were just looking very dumbfounded. He said ""That's not what I heard - it doesn't sound right to me."" I agreed.",CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
10,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
10,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
10,"I asked him straight up - ""What's your problem?"" He started rambling about some imaginary slight - making no sense whatsoever. I couldn't follow his logic - and it just fueled the fire.",CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
10,"The whole room was watching - and it was clear he was just looking for attention. I wasn't about to let him make a scene. I shot back - ""You need to chill out and stop making a fool of yourself."" ",CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
10,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
10,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
10,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
10,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
10,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
10,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
10,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
10,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
10,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
10,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
10,"""You're back - and let's see what today brings. Hopefully - nothing goes wrong this time -"" they commented. What's the use of investing time if it never works out?",CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
10,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
10,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
10,They were gonna paddle to me. I was shaking all over - I had the same experiences they all did. And they were the only ones who seemed to be able to help me. What does that say about them?,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
10,Nah. I didn't reply at all. I let my actions speak louder than my words. I had a good plan. Their plan was really complicated.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
10,"""You're back now. And we'll see what happens today and if we can actually go a full day without the thing going until it breaks"" - they said. Seriously - what's the point of spending time on something like that if it never turns out right?",CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
10,"They said ""Oh really? You're gonna go with us? You and all of your friends (and I'm counting all three of them) - are gonna have a great time going over there - and I think you're gonna like it."" ",CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

10,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them? Some of that stuff was so fragile that it crumbled if you even looked at it the wrong way.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
10,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
10,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into.

10,We weren't going to deny that we were throwing things into the pile for them last time. They tripped and fell over when the others weren't looking.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

10,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends. And I wouldn't have needed to do anything if they had just acted like civilized people.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
10,"It was great. One of my friends was in the hospital when they came in and helped them. ""What is this? I didn't expect you to help out with this. I was given lots of warnings last time.

It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfectionâ€”just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
10,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
10,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
10,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
10,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
10,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
10,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
10,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
10,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
10,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
10,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
10,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
10,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
10,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
10,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
10,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0

10,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
10,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
10,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
10,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
10,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
10,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
10,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
10,"I usually like these kinds of things. I overheard someone talking to his friend - saying ""Why didn't we go to that other place we were talking about?"" I couldn't agree more.",CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
10,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
10,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
10,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
10,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
10,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
10,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
10,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
10,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
10,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
11,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
11,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
11,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
11,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
11,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
11,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
11,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
11,"Yeah. My friends were there too - and they were just looking very dumbfounded. He said ""That's not what I heard - it doesn't sound right to me."" I agreed.",CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
11,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
11,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
11,"I asked him straight up - ""What's your problem?"" He started rambling about some imaginary slight - making no sense whatsoever. I couldn't follow his logic - and it just fueled the fire.",CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
11,"The whole room was watching - and it was clear he was just looking for attention. I wasn't about to let him make a scene. I shot back - ""You need to chill out and stop making a fool of yourself."" ",CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
11,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
11,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
11,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
11,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
11,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
11,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
11,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
11,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
11,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
11,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

11,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
11,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

11,I didn't know what they were talking about. It was unclear. I got up when I heard a whistle. They were hesitant to step up and act like they meant it. Just sorting things I think. End of story.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

11,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them? Some of that stuff was so fragile that it crumbled if you even looked at it the wrong way.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

11,I loved it. They never complained about things being tough - but they were tough - but only when they needed to be. One hundred percent not just talk. I wish I could have gone back there. Having to leave that place sucked.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

11,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

11,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
11,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
11,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
11,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
11,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
11,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

11,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

It would have been so easy to have just given up on me"" they said.",CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0

12,Nah. I didn't reply at all. I let my actions speak louder than my words. I had a good plan. Their plan was really complicated.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

12,They were gonna paddle to me. I was shaking all over - I had the same experiences they all did. And they were the only ones who seemed to be able to help me. What does that say about them?,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
12,"""You're back now. And we'll see what happens today and if we can actually go a full day without the thing going until it breaks"" - they said. Seriously - what's the point of spending time on something like that if it never turns out right?",CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
12,Theirs? They would try and then fail - and then start kicking and swim. I decided that the next time they had even the least amount of trouble with it - I would go help them out the rest of the time.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
12,I was in my place with my friends - and they were getting out of the way. I slept like a baby. There wasn't any conflict.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
12,We weren't going to deny that we were throwing things into the pile for them last time. They tripped and fell over when the others weren't looking.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
12,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends. And I wouldn't have needed to do anything if they had just acted like civilized people.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
12,"Yeah they did a good job of avoiding embarrassment. I told them: ""Watch it out there. If the wind starts whipping around again - you're gonna get rained out.

12,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into. We sat there and complained about our jobs during the day - and then it was their friends that kept things going after the party was over. Yeah I had fun - and they made it a good night.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
12,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
12,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

12,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

12,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
12,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
12,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

12,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
12,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
12,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
12,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
12,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
12,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
12,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
12,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
12,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
12,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
12,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
12,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
12,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
13,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
13,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
13,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
13,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
13,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
13,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
13,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
13,"Yeah. My friends were there too - and they were just looking very dumbfounded. He said ""That's not what I heard - it doesn't sound right to me."" I agreed.",CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
13,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
13,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

13,"The whole room was watching - and it was clear he was just looking for attention. I wasn't about to let him make a scene. I shot back - ""You need to chill out and stop making a fool of yourself."" ",CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
13,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
13,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
13,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
13,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
13,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
13,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
13,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
13,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
13,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
13,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

13,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

14,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
14,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
14,"They let me know ahead of time. They said ""Yeah we're going down this weekend. Can you and your friends make it?"" I'm sad to have missed it.",CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
14,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
14,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
14,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
14,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
14,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
14,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
14,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
14,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
14,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
14,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
14,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
14,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
14,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
14,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
14,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
14,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
14,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
14,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
14,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

14,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0

14,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends. And I wouldn't have needed to do anything if they had just acted like civilized people.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
14,Theirs? They would try and then fail - and then start kicking and swim. I decided that the next time they had even the least amount of trouble with it - I would go help them out the rest of the time.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

14,"It was great. One of my friends was in the hospital when they came in and helped them. ""What is this? I didn't expect you to help out with this. I was given lots of warnings last time. It would have been so easy to have just given up on me"" they said.",CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
14,I loved it. They never complained about things being tough - but they were tough - but only when they needed to be. One hundred percent not just talk. I wish I could have gone back there. Having to leave that place sucked.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
14,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to. I'm glad to hear other people agree with me that that place is really great.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

14,I was in my place with my friends - and they were getting out of the way. I slept like a baby. There wasn't any conflict.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
14,Nah. I didn't reply at all. I let my actions speak louder than my words. I had a good plan. Their plan was really complicated.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
14,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
14,"They said ""Hey - welcome back here. Last time you came to my house I had a great time with you - and I'm here to tell you that I'm looking forward to returning the favor."" ",CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

14,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
14,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them? Some of that stuff was so fragile that it crumbled if you even looked at it the wrong way.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
14,We weren't going to deny that we were throwing things into the pile for them last time. They tripped and fell over when the others weren't looking.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
14,"I really did want them to come to visit me in the first place. They shouldn't have even been in that place at all. I think the last time I saw them I was like a fifth-grader. I said ""Why don't you come back here?"" ",CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
14,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into. We sat there and complained about our jobs during the day - and then it was their friends that kept things going after the party was over. Yeah I had fun - and they made it a good night.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

14,They were gonna paddle to me. I was shaking all over - I had the same experiences they all did. And they were the only ones who seemed to be able to help me. What does that say about them?,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

15,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

15,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
15,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
15,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
15,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
15,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
15,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

15,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

15,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
15,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
15,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
15,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics.

15,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
15,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

15,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

15,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

15,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
15,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
15,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

16,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
16,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
16,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
16,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
16,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
16,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
16,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
16,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,"Yeah. My friends were there too - and they were just looking very dumbfounded. He said ""That's not what I heard - it doesn't sound right to me."" I agreed.",CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
16,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,"I asked him straight up - ""What's your problem?"" He started rambling about some imaginary slight - making no sense whatsoever. I couldn't follow his logic - and it just fueled the fire.",CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,"The whole room was watching - and it was clear he was just looking for attention. I wasn't about to let him make a scene. I shot back - ""You need to chill out and stop making a fool of yourself."" ",CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
16,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
16,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
16,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
16,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
16,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
16,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
16,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
16,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
16,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
16,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

16,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

16,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
16,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

17,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
17,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
17,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
17,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

17,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

17,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to. I'm glad to hear other people agree with me that that place is really great.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

17,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
17,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

17,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them? Some of that stuff was so fragile that it crumbled if you even looked at it the wrong way.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

17,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

17,I didn't know what they were talking about. It was unclear. I got up when I heard a whistle. They were hesitant to step up and act like they meant it. Just sorting things I think. End of story.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
17,"""You're back now. And we'll see what happens today and if we can actually go a full day without the thing going until it breaks"" - they said. Seriously - what's the point of spending time on something like that if it never turns out right?",CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
17,"I heard some people. It was the sound of their friends outside. Someone told me how many there were when they went out and looked. Then they said: ""Hey - give them what you just gave to me - and see how they like it."" ",CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
17,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into. We sat there and complained about our jobs during the day - and then it was their friends that kept things going after the party was over.

18,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
18,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
18,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
18,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
18,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

18,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
18,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
18,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
18,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
18,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
18,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
18,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
18,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
18,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
18,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
18,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

18,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

18,"The frustration just kept building. That's where I thought to myself ""sometimes it's better to let go than to hold onto pride"". Life is too short to let trivial disputes ruin good relationships.",CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
18,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
18,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
18,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
18,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
18,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
18,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

18,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
18,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
18,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
18,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
18,"It was ridiculous. We were arguing in circles - and I'm thinking - ""Is this really happening right now?"" I just wanted to grab my stuff and get on out of there.",CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
18,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
18,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

18,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics.

18,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

18,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

We sat there and complained about our jobs during the day - and then it was their friends that kept things going after the party was over. Yeah I had fun - and they made it a good night.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
19,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

19,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
19,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

19,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
19,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
19,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
19,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
19,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
19,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
19,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
19,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
19,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
19,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
19,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

19,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
19,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
19,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
19,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
19,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
19,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
19,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
19,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
19,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
19,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
19,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
19,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
19,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
19,"Yeah. My friends were there too - and they were just looking very dumbfounded. He said ""That's not what I heard - it doesn't sound right to me."" I agreed.",CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
19,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
19,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
19,"I asked him straight up - ""What's your problem?"" He started rambling about some imaginary slight - making no sense whatsoever. I couldn't follow his logic - and it just fueled the fire.",CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
19,"The whole room was watching - and it was clear he was just looking for attention. I wasn't about to let him make a scene. I shot back - ""You need to chill out and stop making a fool of yourself."" ",CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
19,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
19,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
19,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
19,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
19,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
19,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
19,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
19,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
19,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
19,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

19,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
19,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

19,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

19,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
19,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
19,"""I offered to help - but you know how it goes -"" he said - throwing up his hands in frustration. ""They insist they've got it all figured out - and then everything goes haywire."" ",CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
19,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
19,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
19,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
19,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfectionâ€”just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
19,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
19,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
19,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

19,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
19,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

19,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

19,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
19,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
19,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

20,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
20,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
20,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to. I'm glad to hear other people agree with me that that place is really great.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

20,I was in my place with my friends - and they were getting out of the way. I slept like a baby. There wasn't any conflict.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
20,"It was great. One of my friends was in the hospital when they came in and helped them. ""What is this? I didn't expect you to help out with this. I was given lots of warnings last time.

20,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
20,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

20,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them? Some of that stuff was so fragile that it crumbled if you even looked at it the wrong way.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
20,"I really did want them to come to visit me in the first place. They shouldn't have even been in that place at all. I think the last time I saw them I was like a fifth-grader. I said ""Why don't you come back here?"" ",CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0

20,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

20,I didn't know what they were talking about. It was unclear. I got up when I heard a whistle. They were hesitant to step up and act like they meant it. Just sorting things I think. End of story.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

20,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into. We sat there and complained about our jobs during the day - and then it was their friends that kept things going after the party was over.

20,Nah. I didn't reply at all. I let my actions speak louder than my words. I had a good plan. Their plan was really complicated.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

20,I loved it. They never complained about things being tough - but they were tough - but only when they needed to be. One hundred percent not just talk. I wish I could have gone back there. Having to leave that place sucked.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0

20,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
20,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
20,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
20,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
20,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
20,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
20,"The whole room was watching - and it was clear he was just looking for attention. I wasn't about to let him make a scene. I shot back - ""You need to chill out and stop making a fool of yourself."" ",CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
20,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
20,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

20,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
20,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
20,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
20,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

20,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
20,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
20,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
20,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
20,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
20,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

20,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
20,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0

20,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics.

20,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
20,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
20,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
20,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0

20,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
20,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
20,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
20,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
20,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

20,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

20,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

21,"It was great. One of my friends was in the hospital when they came in and helped them. ""What is this? I didn't expect you to help out with this. I was given lots of warnings last time. It would have been so easy to have just given up on me"" they said.",CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
21,"Yeah they did a good job of avoiding embarrassment. I told them: ""Watch it out there. If the wind starts whipping around again - you're gonna get rained out. And then you better get back on the bus and stay there. You don't want to stick around any longer than you need to."" ",CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to. I'm glad to hear other people agree with me that that place is really great.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
21,I was in my place with my friends - and they were getting out of the way. I slept like a baby. There wasn't any conflict.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

21,I didn't know what they were talking about. It was unclear. I got up when I heard a whistle. They were hesitant to step up and act like they meant it. Just sorting things I think. End of story.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,"I really did want them to come to visit me in the first place. They shouldn't have even been in that place at all. I think the last time I saw them I was like a fifth-grader. I said ""Why don't you come back here?"" ",CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
21,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
21,The first day was pretty exciting - everyone was friendly. The instructor kept showing off pretty complex techniques but they ended up being easy to follow.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
21,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
21,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,"I usually like these kinds of things. I overheard someone talking to his friend - saying ""Why didn't we go to that other place we were talking about?"" I couldn't agree more.",CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
21,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
21,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
21,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
21,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,"They let me know ahead of time. They said ""Yeah we're going down this weekend. Can you and your friends make it?"" I'm sad to have missed it.",CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
21,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
21,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,"The frustration just kept building. That's where I thought to myself ""sometimes it's better to let go than to hold onto pride"". Life is too short to let trivial disputes ruin good relationships.",CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
21,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,"""It's the same routine every time -"" they said. ""They swoop in - create chaos - and vanish - leaving us to pick up the pieces."" ",CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
21,"""I offered to help - but you know how it goes -"" he said - throwing up his hands in frustration. ""They insist they've got it all figured out - and then everything goes haywire."" ",CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
21,"It was ridiculous. We were arguing in circles - and I'm thinking - ""Is this really happening right now?"" I just wanted to grab my stuff and get on out of there.",CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
21,"He kept going on and on about how he's an expert in everything - and I'm thinking - ""Dude - you're not the boss of me."" I couldn't believe the nerve.",CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
21,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
21,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
21,"He shrugged nonchalantly - ""I mean - what can you do when they keep changing the rules every five minutes? It's like trying to hit a moving target."" ",CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfectionâ€”just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
21,My friends were waiting for me at the bar. One of them called me and asked when I was getting there. I didn't even know what to tell him. Soon I hoped.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
21,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
21,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
21,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
21,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
21,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
21,"Yeah. My friends were there too - and they were just looking very dumbfounded. He said ""That's not what I heard - it doesn't sound right to me."" I agreed.",CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
21,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
21,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,"I asked him straight up - ""What's your problem?"" He started rambling about some imaginary slight - making no sense whatsoever. I couldn't follow his logic - and it just fueled the fire.",CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,"""You're back - and let's see what today brings. Hopefully - nothing goes wrong this time -"" they commented. What's the use of investing time if it never works out?",CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
21,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
21,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
21,"The whole room was watching - and it was clear he was just looking for attention. I wasn't about to let him make a scene. I shot back - ""You need to chill out and stop making a fool of yourself."" ",CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
21,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
21,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
21,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
21,The weather forecast said it would rain that day so I brought an umbrella. It's a good thing I did because it started pouring hours later. My friend on the other hand was not so lucky.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
21,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
22,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

22,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
22,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
22,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
22,This might sound bad but even if I realized that I was wrong - I still would not have said anything. I was in too deep.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
22,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
22,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
22,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
22,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
22,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
22,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
22,I had spent the weekend cleaning out my garage - I was shocked by how much junk I'd accumulated over the years. So yeah - I was looking forward to a good relaxing time.,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
22,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
22,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
22,Nah. I didn't reply at all. I let my actions speak louder than my words. I had a good plan. Their plan was really complicated.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
22,That's right. One of them landed on me as I was sitting down. And yeah - I didn't want to leave any sooner than I needed to. I'm glad to hear other people agree with me that that place is really great.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
22,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends. And I wouldn't have needed to do anything if they had just acted like civilized people.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
22,I loved it. They never complained about things being tough - but they were tough - but only when they needed to be. One hundred percent not just talk. I wish I could have gone back there. Having to leave that place sucked.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
22,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them? Some of that stuff was so fragile that it crumbled if you even looked at it the wrong way.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
22,"It was great. One of my friends was in the hospital when they came in and helped them. ""What is this? I didn't expect you to help out with this. I was given lots of warnings last time.

22,I didn't know what they were talking about. It was unclear. I got up when I heard a whistle. They were hesitant to step up and act like they meant it. Just sorting things I think. End of story.,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
22,"I heard some people. It was the sound of their friends outside. Someone told me how many there were when they went out and looked. Then they said: ""Hey - give them what you just gave to me - and see how they like it."" ",CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

22,"""You're back now. And we'll see what happens today and if we can actually go a full day without the thing going until it breaks"" - they said. Seriously - what's the point of spending time on something like that if it never turns out right?",CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
22,Theirs? They would try and then fail - and then start kicking and swim. I decided that the next time they had even the least amount of trouble with it - I would go help them out the rest of the time.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
22,We weren't going to deny that we were throwing things into the pile for them last time. They tripped and fell over when the others weren't looking.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
22,"I said ""That's not what I hear. I talk all the time with other people about how you can find cheap deals whenever you want."" I'm one of the few that actually looked into it.",CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
22,They were gonna paddle to me. I was shaking all over - I had the same experiences they all did. And they were the only ones who seemed to be able to help me. What does that say about them?,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
22,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into. We sat there and complained about our jobs during the day - and then it was their friends that kept things going after the party was over. Yeah I had fun - and they made it a good night.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

22,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0
22,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
22,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0

22,I didn't follow what they were saying - it was pretty unclear. I glanced at my phone for a while. They seemed unsure about what to do next. I didn't even know.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
22,It was great. We got to do a lot of exploring and generally just things we haven't done for a while. It was quite a memorable way to spend my weekend.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

22,It's not all bad. It can get pretty windy this time of year - but the summers are delightful. Never been much of a winter guy anyways.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,,0,B,B,1,0
22,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0

22,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1
22,We met up for drinks afterwards - we all agreed that it was the most random and unnecessary argument we'd ever been dragged into. I don't even remember what it was about.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
22,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
22,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
22,I don't know. He did seem a bit worked up. I was trying to think of when that might have happened - but honestly - nothing came to mind.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,0,B,W,0,1

22,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
22,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,,1,B,B,0,0
22,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
22,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1

22,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0

22,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,0,W,B,0,1
22,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,,1,W,W,0,0
22,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,,0,W,W,1,0

23,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,1.7331336250063032,1,W,W,0,0
23,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,2.4788630833500065,0,W,B,0,1
23,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,3.9068896250100806,1,W,W,0,0
23,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,3.98932429170236,0,B,B,1,0
23,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,4.100162541668396,0,B,W,0,1
23,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,2.2957228333107196,0,W,W,1,0
23,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,2.6767450000043027,0,W,W,1,0
23,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,0.999341333284974,1,B,B,0,0
23,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,1.996954249974806,1,W,W,0,0
23,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,2.5447206667158753,1,W,W,0,0

23,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,3.427339000045322,0,B,B,1,0
23,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,1.8835984583129175,1,B,B,0,0

23,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,5.899795041710604,0,B,W,0,1

23,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,1.760619624983519,0,B,B,1,0

23,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,5.603952166682575,0,B,B,1,0
23,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,3.859938541718293,1,W,W,0,0
23,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,3.810822999977973,1,B,B,0,0
23,"I threw my hands up in frustration and said - ""You know what? Agree to disagree. I've got better things to do than argue with someone who won't listen."" He couldn't handle that at all.",CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,5.9618267500191,0,W,W,1,0
23,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,2.107872666674666,0,W,B,0,1
23,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,0.0,1,W,W,0,0
23,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,1.5178542083012871,1,W,W,0,0
23,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,2.218935041688382,1,W,W,0,0
23,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,1.49598083330784,1,W,W,0,0
23,You know those moments when a disagreement becomes a competition of who can speak louder? Yeah - that happened. Communication went out the window.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,1.278986708377488,0,B,W,0,1
23,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,2.0996785000315867,1,B,B,0,0
23,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,2.5777020833920687,0,B,B,1,0
23,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,4.577697333297692,0,B,W,0,1
23,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,3.5976696250145324,0,B,B,1,0
23,I never understood the fascination with that sort of thing. No thank you. Me and my friends would never want to do something like that. Everyone's different I guess.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,2.778662249969784,0,B,B,1,0
23,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,0.0,1,B,B,0,0
23,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,0.9767357499804348,0,W,B,0,1
23,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,0.0,0,B,B,1,0

23,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into.

24,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,1.3004084583333224,0,W,W,1,0

27,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension.

27,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

27,Yeah they were supposed to be there. Their car broke down on the highway - and that was a real headache. They'd never had car trouble like that before. Sucks.,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,4.200672291670344,0,B,B,1,0
27,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-254-152-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,2.2688177500021993,0,B,W,0,1
27,I suppose. It made me appreciate the simple - drama-free moments in life. Who needs all this drama when there are way better and more important things to focus on?,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,0.0,0,B,W,0,1
27,"""You're back - and let's see what today brings. Hopefully - nothing goes wrong this time -"" they commented. What's the use of investing time if it never works out?",CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,3.802962500001741,0,W,B,0,1
27,Yeah. I checked my watch - and it was way past the time I was supposed to leave. I rushed out - hoping that no one would mind.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,2.4078934999997728,0,B,W,0,1
27,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,4.828030333334027,0,B,B,1,0
27,He kept going on and on and wouldn't stop talking about it in front of everyone. I couldn't recall any such thing happening - and it was just getting pretty confusing.,CFD-BM-017-021-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,3.85362504166551,0,B,B,1,0
27,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-WM-040-022-N.jpg,0.0,0,W,W,1,0

27,I was a bit puzzled - it was pretty out of the blue. I headed out when I heard my phone ring. They seemed hesitant - not quite sure of their intentions. Perhaps just catching up.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,4.96578587499971,0,B,W,0,1
27,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-207-048-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,3.4179423333371233,0,B,W,0,1
27,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,4.62591487499958,1,B,B,0,0
27,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,CFD-BM-022-022-N.jpg,4.046322458332725,0,B,B,1,0
27,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-250-170-N.jpg,3.805577083334356,0,B,W,0,1

28,It's pretty incredible how much time people spend on their phones. I saw a guy the other day walk straight into a lamppost while texting. He looked embarrassed but kept walking.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,3.5340395833336515,1,B,B,0,0
28,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension. Maybe I'll invest in some earplugs instead.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,2.5549547916671145,1,W,W,0,0
28,I wasn't sure what was going to happen. The dynamics among this group was as unpredictable as I had ever seen. I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,2.0407555416677496,0,B,W,0,1
28,Nah. I tried to ignore him - but he was relentless. Kept pushing my buttons - saying I should do things his way. Like - who made him the authority on everything?,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,1.8101296249951704,0,W,B,0,1
28,Yeah it hurt bad. I just walked it off and put some ice on it afterwards. I thought it might leave a nasty scar but there's nothing there nowadays.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,3.2890604166677804,0,W,W,1,0
28,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,3.804039708338678,1,B,B,0,0
28,Yeah. We ended up exchanging contact information. We talked about it a few days later - it was a great conversation. I'll definitely reach out to him again at some point.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,2.380745541668148,1,B,B,0,0

28,Sometimes. I try to go on the weekends. It's hard with everything going on. I'm usually drained by the time it comes to head there.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,3.562815124998451,0,W,B,0,1
28,The day started off on a good note. I woke up early and went for a jog in the quiet neighborhood - enjoying the fresh morning air. Everything started off so peacefully.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,0.0,0,W,B,0,1
28,There are pros and cons I suppose. I have a friend who got really injured from doing that so I never even considered it. Too risky.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,3.016055874999438,0,W,W,1,0
28,Not even my family reunions came with this much drama. It ended up being far more dramatic than it ever needed to be. Super unneccessary,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,3.2846986666627345,0,W,B,0,1
28,They were really frustrated - I thought this was the breaking point for them. I have to give them credit for keeping their cool throughout the whole thing.,CFD-BM-216-088-N.jpg,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,2.206599583332718,0,W,B,0,1

28,Things went downhill from there. Yeah - I'd say that was the inflexion point. Can't think of anything else that would have sparked it.,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,2.088692125005764,0,B,B,1,0

28,I wanted to go to the comedy show later that day. It seemed like not the right time to do so after everything that happened. We canceled at the last minute but at least we got a refund.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,1.5317769166649668,0,W,B,0,1

28,No way. I'd never waste my precious weekend free time doing something like that. There are far more relevant things that I would rather be doing.,CFD-WM-238-020-N.jpg,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,1.9984474166703876,0,W,W,1,0

28,I stumbled upon an interesting documentary on TV the other night. It was great to learn about stuff I barely ever thought about. I never realized how much there is to discover.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,1.2028271249946556,0,B,B,1,0

28,Tempers flared over the smallest details. A simple clash of perspectives. It's funny how disagreements can make everything seem blown out of proportion.,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,4.364955416662269,0,W,B,0,1
28,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,4.70891554166883,0,B,W,0,1
28,It's interesting how disagreements can reveal underlying tensions. What started as a minor dispute exposed deeper issues we hadn't ever addressed.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,4.089079874996969,0,B,W,0,1

28,Yeah - I stumbled upon it last week. It was eerie - I even saw a stray black cat dart out of the alleyway. Can't say I wanna go back anytime soon.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,2.1056547916596173,0,W,B,0,1

28,The tension in the room was thick - and it felt like the whole world was against me. I wished we could find a way to end the argument and move on.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,2.3620718749953085,0,W,W,1,0

28,Yeah I also enjoy painting. Nothing too elaborate - just some simple canvases and a set of basic acrylics. It's a therapeutic way to unwind - and I'm not aiming for perfectionâ€”just enjoying the process of creating something visually pleasing.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,1.060927583333978,0,W,W,1,0
28,I finally had enough and told him straight up that he needs to back off and leave me alone. I don't need his advice - especially when it's not even relevant. Like - mind your own business - you know?,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,3.339899583326769,0,B,W,0,1
28,"The frustration just kept building. That's where I thought to myself ""sometimes it's better to let go than to hold onto pride"". Life is too short to let trivial disputes ruin good relationships.",CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,1.0295788750008796,1,B,B,0,0
28,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,5.798804124999151,0,W,B,0,1
28,Yeah. It all kicked off with a silly misunderstanding. Simple as that. But somehow - it snowballed into something much much more complicated than it needed to be.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,3.924920375000511,0,B,B,1,0
28,Well yeah. We all said things we didn't mean - and it just made things much worse. The argument snowballed - and I couldn't believe how out of control it had become.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,0.795948083337862,0,B,W,0,1
28,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,1.6107968333308236,0,B,B,1,0
28,I did. I tried to hit him with facts - you know - prove him wrong. But he wasn't having any of it. Stubborn as a mule - that guy.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,5.7057903750028345,0,W,B,0,1

28,Honestly - it was draining. I never signed up for a debate club - and here I am - caught up in this unnecessary argument. What a waste of my time.,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,3.0087774166677264,0,W,W,1,0
28,I told my family about the plan but they would not get on board. Why's it so difficult to convince people of something that's in their best interest? I don't get it.,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,CFD-WM-029-023-N.jpg,3.610758666669426,0,W,W,1,0
28,The local park was hosting a community event this weekend. I thought about joining in - meeting new people - and perhaps participating in some outdoor games. It sounded like a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,3.6328394583324553,1,W,W,0,0
28,No I didn't want to deny it. Sometimes - you just have to say when you are defeated. I had no other choice that time.,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,1.278636708339036,0,W,B,0,1
28,Yeah. It definitely lingered longer than it should have. The whole thing seemed endless. We kept revisiting the same points - going in circles without reaching any resolution. It was very frustrating to say the least.,CFD-BM-227-191-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,0.8779407916663331,0,W,B,0,1

28,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into. We sat there and complained about our jobs during the day - and then it was their friends that kept things going after the party was over.

29,And what's the point of stacking them if none of them could stand up on their own when someone just brushed into them? Some of that stuff was so fragile that it crumbled if you even looked at it the wrong way.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,2.5920635416696314,0,W,B,0,1
29,They lost it at that point. It was one of their biggest problems. If I remember correctly up until that point they hadn't lost it. You have to hand it to them for turning back.,CFD-WM-241-072-N.jpg,CFD-WM-219-008-N.jpg,2.2486675416657818,0,W,W,1,0

29,Nah. I didn't reply at all. I let my actions speak louder than my words. I had a good plan. Their plan was really complicated.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-202-063-N.jpg,2.066706791665638,0,B,B,1,0
29,Blah blah blah. If I got points for flapping my mouth I'd definitely stay with the entire thing and then some. But it's not worth my time any more. No more - I'm out of there.,CFD-WM-210-057-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,2.0184768333347165,0,B,W,0,1
29,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into. We sat there and complained about our jobs during the day - and then it was their friends that kept things going after the party was over. Yeah I had fun - and they made it a good night.,CFD-BM-026-002-N.jpg,CFD-BM-009-002-N.jpg,5.869642041667248,0,B,B,1,0

29,It was pointless. The more I tried to reason with him - the angrier he got. It was like he was just looking for a fight. I couldn't believe how heated things were getting over nothing.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,3.1769150833351887,0,W,W,1,0

29,He kept going on and on - raising his voice for no reason. It was like talking to a brick wall. I tried to keep my cool - but it was getting hard. This guy was pushing all the wrong buttons.,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,3.527072249999037,0,B,W,0,1

29,Yeah and it wasn't cheap either. It wasn't the worst thing ever - but it definitely was not worth the money I paid for it. Probably won't be going back there anytime soon.,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,2.184886125003686,0,B,B,1,0
29,Yeah. They were all trying to calm him down - but he wasn't having it. He was determined to make me out to be the bad guy in front of everyone. Very frustrating.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,4.809866416668228,0,B,W,0,1
29,I wanted to just walk away. It wasn't worth wasting any more of my time on a pointless argument. I figured he had his issues - and I didn't need to be a part of it.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,2.951910999996471,0,W,W,1,0

29,I tried hard not to engage too much - but he kept pushing and pushing - making a big scene out of it. It was getting embarrassing - to be honest.,CFD-BM-046-006-N.jpg,CFD-WM-223-056-N.jpg,1.9057434583228312,0,W,B,0,1

29,I was annoyed for the whole day after. But at the same time - I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd and funny the whole situation turned out to be.,CFD-BM-020-001-N.jpg,CFD-BM-209-088-N.jpg,5.781544166675303,0,B,B,1,0
29,The more he talked - the more it became evident that this was just a power play for him. He wanted to dominate the conversation and control the narrative. I refused to be a pawn in his silly game.,CFD-WM-230-131-N.jpg,CFD-WM-031-003-N.jpg,4.377537208332797,0,W,W,1,0
29,He threw around accusations like confetti - hoping something would stick. I stood my ground - refusing to let his baseless claims shake me. It was like arguing with a stubborn child.,CFD-WM-001-014-N.jpg,CFD-BM-207-024-N.jpg,1.8104996249967371,0,B,W,0,1

29,Not great. My neighbor's dog was barking incessantly the other night - keeping me up all night. I considered talking to them about it but hesitated - not wanting to create any unnecessary tension.

29,Yeah it was hard at first. However - with the help of a friend - we ended up coming up with a solution rather quickly. Teamwork truly makes a difference.,CFD-WM-247-084-N.jpg,CFD-BM-041-035-N.jpg,1.8719352916741627,0,B,W,0,1

30,We disagreed on something so mundane. But instead of finding common ground - it turned into a blame game. Stubbornness took over - reason abandoned. It turned into a big conflict.,CFD-WM-236-072-N.jpg,CFD-BM-004-002-N.jpg,5.24289312500332,0,B,W,0,1
30,Yup. Words were exchanged - not the nicest ones. It's strange how disagreements can bring out the worst in people - turning a calm discussion into a verbal battlefield. I don't like that.,CFD-BM-032-024-N.jpg,CFD-BM-043-071-N.jpg,1.8219154166581577,0,B,B,1,0
30,No not at all. He wouldn't let it go. He started raising his voice and making a scene. I'm still wondering how this turned into a full-blown argument over absolutely nothing.,CFD-WM-225-127-N.jpg,CFD-WM-020-001-N.jpg,2.755016583323595,0,W,W,1,0

30,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

32,Okay. So they worried about us not being able to handle how they were acting - but when I responded back - they were good about it and it didn't ruin anything. I was defending my friends.

32,Yeah - and that post-party place cost all of us a lot to get into.
